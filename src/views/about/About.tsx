            <h3>Aspiring Software Engineer!</h3>
            <div className="text">
              <p>Hey there! I'm <span>Angelo Rojas Tangonan</span>, a budding software engineer driven by a love for problem-solving and the wonders of technology. While I hail from the Philippines, Aotearoa New Zealand has been my home for most of my life.</p>
              <p>Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by the way technology influences our world, which naturally led me to pursue a career in software engineering. My particular focus lies in web development, with a strong interest in full-stack development.</p>
              <p>Beyond software engineering, I'm a passionate advocate for gender diversity in STEM. Through volunteering and mentorship, I work to empower underrepresented groups, to help foster a more inclusive environment for all to thrive. I believe diversity drives innovation and I strive to contribute to a future where the tech industry reflects our global diversity.</p>
              <p>Kindly note that this portfolio website is still being developed. Thanks for your patience! ðŸ˜Š</p>
